# Wolf Game Simulator
A command-line simulation of the game “What Time Is It, Mr. Wolf?”, built in C++ using a custom linked list. Players spawn at (x,y) coordinates and move closer to the wolf based on time commands. The wolf can eliminate nearby players, and the game ends when the player team or the wolf wins. Supports commands to spawn, update, remove, and list players.
